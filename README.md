# PetMe

### Description
This app provides a list of pets accessed from a local SQLite database.
Additionally, it allows saving and editing of those entries via the Android SQLite APIs.
Due to the implementation of Room, and the subsequent deprecation of these APIs, this project is unfinished.

This project was built for the Udacity Android Developement for Beginners nanodegree, starting code was accessed from:
https://github.com/udacity/ud845-Pets/tree/starting-point

### What I accomplished in this project:

* Built a SQLite database and the necessary Contract to access it from scratch.
* Allowed for reading and writing from said database.
